# The screenshot contraption

Just a simple working solution to take automatic screenshots.
UPDATE : If you want to take screenshots using the OS screen capture this script is the right one but I made another one that works
on the background using ffmpeg, it's more efficient for use with local video files, you can check it here : [screenshot_contraption2](https://github.com/monsieurr/screenshot_contraption2)


## But Why ?

I made this script because I wanted to capture interesting shots of movies without having to manually take screenshots.
By extracting a picture every X seconds, most of the great shots get captured.
I can then keep the most captivating ones for inspiration.

## How to use

There's a script (script_screen.py) and a GUI (script_screen_gui.py)
It's still barely working but enough for my use (dev oriented)
I will probably package it and make it executable at some point.
Just try it if you want but it might explode ðŸ’¥
