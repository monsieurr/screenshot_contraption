# The screenshot contraption

Just a simple working solution to take automatic screenshots.

## But Why ?

I made this script because I wanted to capture interesting shots of movies without having to manually take screenshots.
By extracting a picture every X seconds, most of the great shots get captured.
I can then keep the most captivating ones for inspiration.

## How to use

There's a script (script_screen.py) and a GUI (script_screen_gui.py)
It's still barely working but enough for my use (dev oriented)
I will probably package it and make it executable at some point.
Just try it if you want but it might explode ðŸ’¥
